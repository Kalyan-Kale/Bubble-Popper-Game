How to Play:

1) Pop Bubbles, Beat the Clock: In Bubble Popper, players are challenged to pop bubbles as quickly as possible by simply clicking on them. You'll be up against the relentless ticking of the clock, so every second counts!

2) Chase High Scores: To truly excel in Bubble Popper, it's not just about popping bubbles randomly. Look for the numbered bubbles â€“ they hold the key to earning a top score. Click on as many numbered bubbles as you can to rack up points. Each bubble displays a number in a box, and this number is your target.

3) Earn Points with Precision: For every correct click on a bubble that matches the number displayed in its box, you'll earn 10 valuable points. The more accurate and swift you are, the higher your score will soar.

4) Changing Challenges: Bubble Popper keeps you on your toes with a twist! After every successful pop, the number in the box changes. So, be prepared to adapt and strategize on the fly. The game will challenge your ability to stay focused and make split-second decisions.
